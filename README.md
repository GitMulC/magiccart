## UX

Magic Cart was created primarily as an e-commerce store. Additional features such as wishlist, events and community sharing were added to keep user engagement up and get them more engaged with the Magic the Gathering community. 

### Colour Scheme

The `#F5B841` orange colour was utilised as it is similar to the colour of the orginal Magic: The Gathering logo font. This original logo served as inspiration for the colour scheme. This colour was used in the menu bar, and footer.

A black colour `#000000` was used for most of the text on the site, primarily for the `<p>` sections. This colour font serves as an excellent contrast to the `#F5B841` colour used. It was also used in the footer for social media icons and to highlight the form link.

The white colour `#ffffff` was used as a secondary background colour to compliment the harsh orange and make viewing things center of screen less harsh. Made it easier to focus on the details outside the header and footer.

### Typography

The eczar font looks similar to the belern font used in Magic: The Gathering products and logos. Since the belern is a copyrighted font and cannot be used outside of Magic: The Gathering products, eczar was the font selected as the most appropriate.
