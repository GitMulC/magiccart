### Colour Scheme

The `#ff8800` orange colour was utilised as it is similar to the colour of the orginal Magic: The Gathering logo font. This original logo served as inspiration for the colour scheme. This colour was used in headings, menu bar, footer and in the logo.

A white colour `#ffffff` was used for most of the text on the site, primarily for the `<p>` sections. It was also used in the footer for social media icons and to highlight the form link.

The black colour `#f0f0f0` was used as a background colour primarily. It is found in the header and footer as a background colour and serves as an excellent contrast for the orange `#ff8800` colour.
